    <h4 style="background-color: #DDDDDD; text-align:right;"><i>Learn how to automatically preserve the formatting in Google Sheet when new Google Form responses are submitted.</i></h4>
    <p style="background-color:#ADCF9F; color:white;">When you submit a Google Form, it stores a copy of the form response as a new row in the Google Sheet.<br> The only problem here is that Google Forms will not add any formatting or styles to the new
      row that you may have applied to the previous rows
      of the sheet.<br> Let me illustrate this with a small example.
      <br>

      Here’s a Google Sheet that is storing Google Form responses. I’ve changed the default font family to Droid Sans, center-aligned the Country and Age column and also applied a different date format to the Date of Birth column.

    <p style="background-color:#ADCF9F; color:white;">Everything looks good but as soon as a new form submissions is made, the new row appended to the Google Sheet via Google Forms will lose all the formatting.<br>

      The cell alignment is not preserved, the custom date formats are ignored and so is the default font size and font family.<br>
      Here’s a screenshot of the same sheet but with a new row added through Google Forms.

    <h4 style="background-color: #05595B; color: white; text-align:right;"><i>Learn how to design your own outline stickers from photos in Canva with transparent background.</i></h4>
    <img src="img4.jpg" style="width: 540px;
    height: 400px;"  alt="image">
    <p style="background-color:#E2D784; color:black;">This quick tutorial will walk you through the steps to create your own custom stickers from photos in Canva. <br>The basic idea is that you remove the background from the photo, add a thick white border around the cut out image <br> and save it as a
      PNG file with a transparent background.

      Here are the steps:<br> <b>Step 1: Add the Photo to Canvas</b><br>
      Create a new design in Canva and drag the photo from your desktop to the canvas.</p><br>
    <img src="img5.png" style="width: 540px;
    height: 400px;"  alt="image">
    <p style="background-color:#E2D784; color:black;"><b>Step 2: Remove the Image Background</b><br>
      Select the image, click the Edit Image button and choose the BG Remover option to instantly remove the background.<br> Click Apply to save the changes.
    </p>

    height: 400px;"  alt="image">
    <p style="background-color:#E2D784; color:black;"><b>Step 3: Add a White Outline</b><br>
      While the photo is selected,
      go to Shadows and choose the Glow option.<br>
      Set the background color of the glow to white,
      set the blur to 0 and the transparency to 100%.<br>
      You can now play around with the Size slider to get the desired thickness of the outline.</p><br>
